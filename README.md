    Personal Expense Tracker for Android <br> <a href="https://youtu.be/8o-5a1XjGV4">Video demo</a>
</h3>

BitWault is a simple finance tracker app, with the main purpose of monitoring and documenting expenses. The intial idea was to develop an application which allows the user to record the expenses they made. It was further expanded to include a screen to give some simple insights into monthly spending and trends over the past six months. Later, some more additions like tracking stock holdings of the user, credit card details and banking information such as UPI IDs etc. <br><br>

## Features
Currently, BitWault consists of five main screens, each serving a specific purpose:
* Add Expenses - This screen has a form that allows users to input their expenses into the database.
* Summary - This insights screen displays budget information and categorizes expenses for the current month, along with expense trends over the last six months.
* Investments Tracker - This data screen shows the current value of the user's holdings, along with profits, losses, and sector-wise investments.
* Cards - This simple screen consolidates all card-related information, including card numbers, expiration dates, and CVV codes.
* Banking - This screen contains banking data such as UPI IDs and other miscellaneous information.

### Tech Stack:
* Frontend - React Native with Expo Cli
* Backend - Google Spreadsheets with AppScript
